research: '<p>Companies collect a wide range of personal information from users—from personal details and account profiles to a user’s activities and location. Companies also often share this information with third parties, such as advertisers, governments, and legal authorities. We expect companies to clearly disclose what user information (as RDR defines it) they share and with whom. Company disclosure should specify if it shares user information with governments and with commercial entities. For mobile ecosystems, we expect the company to clearly disclose whether the privacy policies of the apps that are available in its app store specify what user information the apps share with third parties.</p><p>In some cases, laws or regulations may require companies to share certain information or might prohibit or discourage the company from disclosing what user information they share. Researchers will document situations where this is the case, but a company will still lose points if it fails to meet all elements. This represents a situation where the law causes companies to be uncompetitive, and we encourage companies to advocate for laws that enable them to fully respect users’ rights to freedom of expression and privacy.</p><p><b>Potential sources:</b></p><ul><li>Company privacy policy</li><li>Company policies related to sharing data, interaction with third parties</li></ul>'
