research: <p>Companies frequently receive requests from governments to remove, filter, or restrict content or accounts. We expect a company to regularly publish data about the number and type of government requests it receives, and the number of such requests with which it complies. Companies may receive these requests through official processes, such as a court order, or through informal channels, like a flagging system intended to allow private individuals to report content that violates the terms of service. If a company knows that a request is coming from a government entity or court, the company should disclose it as part of its government requests reporting. Disclosing this data helps the public gain a greater understanding of the environment for freedom of expression online and it helps the public hold companies and governments accountable for their obligations to respect and protect freedom of expression rights.</p><p>In some cases, the law might prevent a company from disclosing information referenced in this indicator’s elements. For example, we expect companies to publish exact numbers rather than ranges of numbers. We acknowledge that laws sometimes prevent companies from doing so, and researchers will document situations where this is the case. But a company will nonetheless lose points if it fails to meet all elements. This represents a situation where the law causes companies to fall short of best practice for this indicator, and we encourage companies to advocate for laws that enable them to fully respect users’ rights to freedom of expression and privacy.</p><p><b>Potential sources:</b></p><ul><li>Company transparency report</li></ul><p align="right"><a target="_blank" href="https://rankingdigitalrights.org/2018-indicators/#top">top of section</a></p><h2><a id="F7"></a>F7.
