research: <p>This indicator evaluates whether companies clearly disclose if they engage in practices that affect the flow of content through their networks, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://rankingdigitalrights.org/2018-indicators/#throttling">throttling</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://rankingdigitalrights.org/2018-indicators/#traffic">traffic shaping</a>. We expect companies to publicly commit to avoid prioritization or degradation of content. In some cases companies may engage in legitimate traffic shaping practices in order to ensure the flow of traffic through their networks. If companies do engage in these actions, we expect them to publicly disclose this and to explain their purpose for doing so. Note that this indicator does not address blocking of content; that is addressed in indicator F3. This indicator does, however, include company disclosure related to blocking of services, apps, or devices, which are considered a type of prioritization.</p><p><b>Potential Sources:</b></p><ul><li>Company explanation of network management or traffic management practices</li></ul>
