research: Human rights can only be protected and respected if people have redress when they believe their rights have been violated. This indicator examines whether companies provide such remedy mechanisms and whether they have a publicly disclosed process for responding to complaints or grievance reports from individuals who believe that the company has violated or directly facilitated violation of their freedom of expression or privacy rights. We expect companies to disclose information about how the company responds to complaints or grievance reports from people who believe that their rights to freedom of expression or privacy have been infringed by the company or in connection with the company’s business. This remedy should include a user&#8217;s ability to appeal a company&#8217;s decision to block or remove content or deactivate an account, since such decisions can directly affect that user&#8217;s rights to freedom of expression.</p><p><b>Potential sources:</b></p><ul><li>Company terms of service or equivalent user agreements</li><li>Company content policies</li><li>Company privacy policies, privacy guidelines, or privacy resource site</li><li>Company CSR/sustainability report</li><li>Company help center or user guide</li><li>Company transparency report (for the number of complaints received)</li></ul>
