  <ol><li><i><strong>TA</strong></i> <strong>company</strong>’s terms of service outline the relationship between the user and the company. The terms contain rules for what activities and content users are permitted to engage in and share on a company’s services, and as such, these terms can directly affect users’ freedom of expression rights. Companies can also take action against users for violating the conditions described in the terms. Given this, we expect companies to ensure that users can easily locate these terms and understand what they mean.</li><li>A <i><strong>document</strong></i> that is easy to find is located on the homepage of the company or service, or one or two clicks away from the homepage, or in a logical place where users can expect to find it. The terms should also be available in the major language(s) of the primary operating market. In addition, we expect a company to take steps to help users understand the information presented in their documents. This includes, but is not limited to, providing summaries, tips, or guidance that explain what the terms mean, using section headers, readable font size, or other graphic features to help users understand the document, or writing the terms using readable syntax.</li></ol><p>This indicator includes a review of other documents such as “community guidelines” or service-specific rules that further explain to users what the terms mean. Privacy policies are not included in this indicator since they are covered in separate indicators in the “Privacy” category.</p><p><strong>Potential sources:</strong></p><ul><li>Company terms of service, terms of use, terms and conditions, etc.</li><li>Company acceptable use policy, <i><strong>community</strong></i> guidelines, rules, etc.</li><li>XXX <strong>xxxxxx</strong></li></ul>
