research: <p>Companies often set boundaries for what content users can post on a service as well as what activities users can engage in on the service. Companies can also restrict a user’s account, meaning that the user is unable to access the service, for violating these rules. For mobile ecosystems, this can include restricting access to an end-user’s account or a developer’s account.</p><p>We therefore expect companies to clearly disclose what these rules are and how companies enforce them. This includes information about how companies learn of material or activities that violate their terms. For example, companies may employ staff to review content and/or user activity or they may rely on community flagging mechanisms that allow users to flag other users’ content and/or activity for company review. We also expect companies to clearly disclose whether they have a policy of granting priority or expedited consideration to any government authorities and/or members of private organizations or other entities that identify their organizational affiliation when they report content or users for allegedly violating the company’s rules. For mobile ecosystems, we expect companies to disclose the types of apps they would restrict. In this disclosure, the company should also provide examples to help users understand what these rules mean.</p><p><b>Potential sources:</b></p><ul><li>Company terms of service, user contract</li><li>Company acceptable use policy, community standards, content guidelines, abusive behavior policy, or similar document that explains the rules users have to follow.</li><li>Company support, help center, or FAQ (e.g., questions around why is content removed, why is an account suspended, etc.)</li></ul>
