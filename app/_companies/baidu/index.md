  <p>Baidu earned the lowest score of all internet and mobile ecosystem companies evaluated, disclosing almost no information about its policies and practices affecting users&rsquo; freedom of expression and privacy. The company improved its disclosure of its handling of user information, including its disclosure of options users have to control if their information is used for targeted advertising. However, the company still fell short of meeting basic benchmarks for protecting users&rsquo; freedom of expression and privacy. While the Chinese internet environment is one of the most restrictive in the world, Baidu can still improve its transparency about basic policies affecting freedom of expression and privacy in key areas. The fact that Tencent outperformed Baidu on several such indicators shows that Baidu&rsquo;s poor performance cannot be attributed to China&rsquo;s restrictive legal and political environment alone.</p>

  <p>Baidu scored lowest of all internet and mobile ecosystem companies in the Governance category. The company made a commitment to respect users&rsquo; privacy, although it fell short of committing to protect privacy as a human right (G1). The company disclosed no evidence of senior-level oversight on freedom of expression or privacy issues (G2), or of employee training or a whistleblower program related to these issues (G3). It failed to disclose if it conducts human rights due diligence (G4), or if the company engages with stakeholders on freedom of expression or privacy issues (G5). China&rsquo;s political and legal environment strongly discourages companies from making human rights commitments, but Baidu could still improve its disclosure of grievance and remedy mechanisms (G6).</p>
