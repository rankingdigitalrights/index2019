  <p>Facebook ranked fourth out of the 12 internet and mobile ecosystem companies evaluated, disclosing less about policies and practices affecting freedom of expression and privacy than Microsoft, Google, and Verizon Media.[2] While it introduced a raft of policy changes over the last year in response to public criticism over its unclear content moderation policies and its mishandling of user data, these changes failed to provide sufficient transparency about policies and practices in key areas. Although Facebook improved its disclosure of actions it took to police content and accounts as a result of violations to its own rules, it disclosed less than in previous years about how it responds to government requests to remove content or deactivate accounts. While it made numerous revisions to its privacy policy that clarified different aspects of how it handles user data, these steps still fell vastly short of giving users a clear picture of its data collection and sharing policies&mdash;or clear options to control what is being collected and shared. Facebook also lacked clarity about what it does to keep user data secure, including whether it monitors employee access to user data and its policies for handling data breaches. As in previous years, Facebook&rsquo;s grievance and remedy mechanisms were among the weakest of any company in the Index.</p>
key_recommendation: | 
  <ul><li>Clarify handling of user information. Facebook should disclose more about its handling of user information and its policies to keep user information secure.</li><li>Disclose more about third-party requests. Facebook should disclose data about how it responds to government requests to remove content or deactivate accounts for all of its services.</li><li>Improve appeals mechanisms. Facebook should dramatically improve its grievance and remedy mechanisms for users whose rights to freedom of expression and privacy were affected by the company&rsquo;s policies and practices.</li></ul>

  <p>A member of the Global Network Initiative (GNI), Facebook received the third-best governance score among the 12 internet and mobile ecosystem companies evaluated, behind Microsoft and Verizon Media. While it published a clear commitment to respect and protect human rights to freedom of expression and privacy (G1), it disclosed little about its due diligence efforts aimed at ensuring that its business operations and practices actually protect these rights in practice (G4). For instance, it disclosed nothing about whether it conducts risk assessments around its targeted advertising policies and practices, or about its use of automated decision-making technologies (G4). Facebook also had one of the lowest scores of any company in the Index for its appeals mechanisms&mdash;even after introducing improvements to its appeals process over the last year. In April 2018, Facebook (the social network) unveiled a new process for remedying wrongful takedowns of content but this mechanism is limited to content removed for nudity, hate speech, or graphic violence. Meanwhile, the company lacked a clear appeal mechanism for users to seek remedy when they feel that Facebook has violated their privacy.</p>

  <p>Despite notable improvements, Facebook failed to disclose enough about its policies affecting freedom of expression, and scored below most of its U.S. peers in this category. It provided relatively clear information about its rules and what types of activity and content are prohibited on its services (F3)&mdash;it received one of the top scores on this indicator, after Microsoft&mdash;but provided almost no information about what actions it took to enforce them (F4). While Facebook published its first ever Community Standards Enforcement report&mdash;making it one of just four companies in the Index to disclose data about the nature and volume of content it removed, or accounts it deactivated for rules violations (F4)&mdash;this data applied just to Facebook (the social network) and not to Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p>Facebook also disclosed significantly less than in previous years about its process for handling and complying with government requests to restrict content or accounts (F5-F7). Whereas its previous transparency reports specified that data about compliance with government requests applied to all services, Facebook&rsquo;s latest transparency report (DATES) failed to state if the data included information about WhatsApp or Messenger (F5, F6). The company&rsquo;s overall score in the freedom of expression category declined this year as a result.</p>

  <p>Facebook disclosed less about its privacy policies than all of its U.S. peers&mdash;including Microsoft, Apple, Google, Verizon Media, and Twitter&mdash;and, despite improvements, still did not provide enough information about how it handles user data or its policies for keeping user data secure. While it made numerous revisions to its privacy policy that clarified different aspects of how it handles user data, those revisions fell short of giving users a clear picture of its data collection and sharing policies&mdash;or of options for users to control what is being collected and shared. It remained among the least transparent of any internet and mobile ecosystem company about options users have to control how their data is used, including for the purposes of targeted advertising (P7). Facebook was also less transparent than Google, Apple, and Verizon Media about its policies for keeping user data secure (P13-P18). It revealed little about its policies for limiting employee access to user data (P13), and disclosed nothing about its policies for handling data breaches (P15).</p><p>On the plus side, Facebook&rsquo;s clarifications about ways users can obtain their data (P8) earned it the top score on that indicator. It was among the most transparent internet and mobile ecosystem companies about its handling of government and other types of third-party requests for user information (P10-P12), and was one of the few companies to commit to notifying users of government requests for their data (P12). It also received above average marks for disclosure of its encryption policies (P16); it clearly stated that for WhatsApp, end-to-end encryption is enabled by default, and that Messenger users can enable end-to-end encryption, although it is not enabled by default.</p>
