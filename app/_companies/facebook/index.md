  <p>A member of the Global Network Initiative (GNI), Facebook received the third-best governance score among the 12 internet and mobile ecosystem companies evaluated, behind Microsoft and Verizon Media. While it published a clear commitment to respect and protect human rights to freedom of expression and privacy (G1), it disclosed little about its due diligence efforts aimed at ensuring that its business operations and practices actually protect these rights in practice (G4). For instance, it disclosed nothing about whether it conducts risk assessments around its targeted advertising policies and practices, or about its use of automated decision-making technologies (G4). Facebook also had one of the lowest scores of any company in the Index for its appeals mechanisms&mdash;even after introducing improvements to its appeals process over the last year. In April 2018, Facebook (the social network) unveiled a new process for remedying wrongful takedowns, but it was not clear if the scope of this appeals mechanism includes any type of violation to its Community Guidelines.<a href="#fn7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup></a> Meanwhile, the company lacked a clear appeal mechanism for users to seek remedy when they feel that Facebook has violated their privacy.</p>

  <p>Despite notable improvements, Facebook failed to disclose enough about its policies affecting freedom of expression, and scored below most of its U.S. peers in this category. It provided relatively clear information about its rules and what types of activity and content are prohibited on its services (F3): it received one of the top scores on this indicator, after Microsoft. While Facebook published its first ever Community Standards Enforcement Report in May 2018<a href="#fn8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup></a>&mdash;making it one of just four companies in the RDR Index to disclose data about the nature and volume of content it removed, or accounts it restricted for rules violations (F4)&mdash;this data applied just to Facebook (the social network) and not to Instagram, WhatsApp, or Messenger.</p><p>Facebook also disclosed significantly less than in previous years about its process for handling and complying with government requests to restrict content or accounts (F5-F7). Whereas its previous transparency reports specified that data about compliance with government requests applied to all services, Facebook&rsquo;s latest transparency report (January - June 2018) failed to state if the data included information about WhatsApp or Messenger (F5, F6). The company&rsquo;s overall score in the freedom of expression category declined this year as a result.</p>

  <p>Facebook disclosed less about its privacy policies and practices than most of its U.S. peers, including Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Verizon Media. While it made numerous revisions to its privacy policies that clarified different aspects of how it handles user data, those revisions fell short of giving users a clear picture of its data collection and sharing policies&mdash;or of options for users to control what is being collected and shared. It remained among the least transparent of any internet and mobile ecosystem company about options users have to control how their data is used, including for the purposes of targeted advertising (P7). Facebook was also less transparent than Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Verizon Media about its policies for keeping user data secure (P13-P18): it revealed little about its policies for limiting employee access to user data (P13), and disclosed nothing about its policies for handling data breaches (P15).</p><p>In contrast, Facebook&rsquo;s clarifications about ways users can obtain their data (P8) earned it the top score on that indicator. Of the internet and mobile ecosystem companies evaluated, it was among the most transparent about its handling of government and other types of third-party requests for user information (P10-P12), and was one of the few companies to commit to notifying users of government requests for their data (P12). Like other U.S. companies, Facebook did not divulge the exact number of requests received for user data under Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) requests or National Security Letters (NSLs), or the actions it took in response to these requests, since it is prohibited by law from doing so.<a href="#fn9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup></a> Facebook provided end-to-end encryption by default for WhatsApp, and gave Messenger users the option to enable end-to-end encryption, although it is not on by default. In contrast, it failed to disclose any information about its encryption practices for Instagram (P16).</p>
