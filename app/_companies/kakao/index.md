  <p>Kakao received the sixth-highest score in the Governance category, slightly outperforming its South Korean peer, Samsung. The company made a commitment to protect users&rsquo; privacy, although its commitment fell short of explicitly referring to international human rights standards, and it made no similar commitment with regards to freedom of expression (G1). It disclosed executive- and management-level oversight over privacy issues (G2) and that it trains employees on such issues (G3). While Kakao disclosed some information about assessing privacy impacts, it disclosed little else regarding its implementation of human rights impact assessments (G4), and, like most companies, disclosed no information on whether it assesses freedom of expression and privacy risks associated with its use of automated decision-making and its targeted advertising practices and policies. On a positive note, Kakao disclosed more about its grievance and remedy processes than any other internet and mobile ecosystem company evaluated (G6).<a href="#fn5"><sup>5</sup></a> Companies are required by law to offer users an avenue for lodging grievances.<a href="#fn6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

  <p>Kakao disclosed more information about its policies affecting users&rsquo; freedom of expression than Apple and Facebook, but there was ample room for improvement. Kakao published terms of service that were easy to locate and relatively easy to understand (F1) but did not clarify how it directly notifies users of changes (F2). Kakao revealed more about its policies for restricting content and accounts than many of its peers. It disclosed the types of content and activities it does not allow on its services (F3) and disclosed some information about its policy of notifying users of such restrictions (F8). However, like most companies, Kakao disclosed no data about the volume or types of content or accounts it restricted as a result of terms of service violations (F4).</p><p>Kakao disclosed more than Microsoft, Apple, and Facebook about its handling of government and private requests to remove content or restrict accounts (F5-F7). Kakao was more transparent about its process for responding to private requests than government requests (F5). Notably, the company did not provide data about government requests to restrict content or accounts from outside of South Korea (F6). It disclosed more data about private requests it received to block content or restrict user accounts (F7) than many of its peers, including Apple and Google.</p>

  <p>Kakao disclosed substantially more than its South Korean peer Samsung about policies affecting users&rsquo; privacy and security, but disclosed less than all of the U.S.-based internet and mobile ecosystem companies. Kakao&rsquo;s privacy policies were easy to find and understand, and disclosed a commitment to notify users of changes to these policies, though it was not always clear how users would be notified (P1, P2). Kakao clearly disclosed what types of user information it collects (P3) and disclosed the most about what user information it shares and with whom (P4). However, it was less transparent about its purposes for collecting and sharing user information (P5), and failed to disclose a time frame for deleting information when users terminate their accounts (P6). It provided users with some options to control the company&rsquo;s collection of their information and the right to opt out of targeted advertising (P7). It disclosed nothing about whether or how it tracks users across the internet (P9).</p><p>Kakao disclosed less about how it handles government and private requests for user information than all U.S. internet and mobile ecosystem companies evaluated, but more than the rest of its peers (P10, P11). It provided no information about whether it notifies users of government or private requests for user information (P12). Kakao offered more disclosure than Facebook and its South Korean counterpart Samsung about its security policies (P13-P18). It was the only company to fully disclose the internal measures it takes to secure users&rsquo; information, including conducting security audits and limiting and monitoring employee access to user data (P13). It improved its transparency about how it addresses data breaches (P15). However, it provided insufficient information about measures taken to address security vulnerabilities (P14) and its encryption practices across different services (P16).</p>
