  <p>Ooredoo received no credit on any indicator in this category, and disclosed nothing about its governance and oversight over human rights issues at the company.<a href="#fn6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup></a> It did not make a public commitment to respect freedom of expression and privacy in line with international human rights principles (G1), nor did it disclose having senior-level oversight over these issues within the company (G2). Although it disclosed a whistleblower policy, it did not specify if it pertains to freedom of expression or privacy issues (G3). It offered no evidence that it has human rights due diligence processes in place (G4), or if it engages with stakeholders on freedom of expression or privacy issues (G5). Ooredoo Qatar did not offer a grievance mechanism for users to submit freedom of expression and privacy-related complaints, and there was no additional information about how it receives and responds to such grievances (G6).</p>

  <p>Ooredoo disclosed minimal information about its policies affecting freedom of expression and tied with Axiata for the second-lowest score among telecommunications companies, ahead of MTN and Bharti Airtel. Ooredoo Qatar offered terms of service that were easy to find and understand (F1), and those terms gave some information about its rules and how they are enforced (F3).<a href="#fn7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup></a> It also disclosed some information about why it may need to shut down or restrict access to its networks (F10), though it did not disclose any other information about how it handles government demands to shut down its networks.</p><p>Ooredoo otherwise earned no credit on any of the other indicators in this category. Ooredoo Qatar failed to disclose any information about its network management policies (F9). The company also provided no information about its process for responding to government or private requests to block content or restrict users&rsquo; accounts (F5), nor did it supply any data about the number of government or private requests to restrict content or accounts that it received or with which it complied (F6, F7). There is no apparent legal barrier to supplying this information. The lack of disclosure is likely a result of Ooredoo being majority state-owned as well as due to a general lack of transparency in the Qatari legal environment. Telecommunications companies in Qatar are legally required to comply with all judicial orders to block content, though there is no law prohibiting Ooredoo from disclosing its processes for handling these requests or its compliance rates with either government or private content-blocking requests.<a href="#fn8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup></a></p>

  <p>Ooredoo received the lowest privacy score of all companies evaluated. Ooredoo Qatar did not publish a privacy policy for any of its services, making it impossible for users to understand what the company does with their information, including what it collects, shares, and why (P1-P8). Ooredoo Qatar was also the only company to disclose nothing about its policies for keeping users&rsquo; information secure (P13-P18). It did not disclose whether it has systems in place to monitor or limit employee access to user information (P13), nor did it provide any information about its processes for addressing security vulnerabilities or for handling data breaches (P14, P15). <br /><br />Ooredoo provided no information about how it handles government or private requests for user information, making it one of four companies, alongside MTN, Etisalat, and Axiata, that received no credit on these indicators (P10, P11, P12). It provided no information about its process for responding to these types of requests (P10), or whether it notifies users when their information is requested (P12). Ooredoo also failed to publish any data on the number of requests it received for user information (P11). The lack of disclosure is likely a result of Ooredoo being majority state-owned as well as from a general lack of transparency in the Qatari legal environment. Still, there is no law specifically prohibiting Ooredoo from disclosing its policies for responding to user information requests that come through private processes.</p>
