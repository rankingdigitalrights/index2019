  <p>Telef&oacute;nica significantly improved disclosure of its governance and oversight over human rights issues, earning the highest score in this category of any company in the 2019 RDR Index. It earned the highest score on all six indicators in the Governance category, and stood out for disclosing the clearest grievance and remedy mechanism of any company in the entire Index (G6). Notably, Telef&oacute;nica was among the few companies evaluated to disclose that it assesses freedom of expression and privacy risks associated with enforcing its terms of service and its use of automated decision making technologies. However, it failed to disclose if it assesses risks associated with its targeted advertising practices and policies (G4).</p>

  <p>Although Telef&oacute;nica disclosed more about policies affecting freedom of expression than any other telecommunications company evaluated, it still fell short in key areas. The operating company Telef&oacute;nica Spain&rsquo;s terms of service were somewhat difficult to find and understand (F1), and it was not clear whether users would be directly notified of changes (F2).<a href="#fn5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup></a> Telef&oacute;nica improved its disclosure of how it responds to government requests, including those submitted by governments in foreign jurisdictions, but was less transparent about how it responds to requests it receives through private processes (F5). Telef&oacute;nica provided some data about government requests it received and complied with (F6), but no data about requests received through private processes (F7).</p><p>Telef&oacute;nica Spain was one of only two companies to commit to upholding net neutrality principles (F9). The company only partially disclosed the reasons why it may shut down or restrict access to its networks or certain protocols, though it was the only company to disclose both the number of requests it received and with which it complied (F10).</p>

privacy_text: | 
  <p>Telef&oacute;nica made a number of improvements to its policies affecting privacy, but still lacked disclosure in a number of areas. Telef&oacute;nica Spain revealed more than most of its peers about how it handles user information (P3-P8)&mdash;and made some key improvements&mdash;but could do more to clearly explain what user data it shares with third parties (P4), and options users have to control what data it collects and uses, including for purposes of targeted advertising (P7). It disclosed some information about its data retention policies, but did not disclose how long it retains personal data once users terminate their accounts (P6).</p><p>Telef&oacute;nica was more transparent than most of its peers about how it handles government and private requests for user information (P10-P11). It clarified its process for responding to government requests for user data, including those submitted by foreign governments (P10), and provided some data on government requests for user information, though this data could be more comprehensive (P11). But like most companies in the Index, it lacked transparency about how it handles private requests for user information (P10, P11)&mdash;and did not disclose if it notifies users when government entities or other types of third parties request information (P12).</p><p>Telef&oacute;nica Spain disclosed less than Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone UK, and AT&amp;T about its security policies and practices (P13-P18). It disclosed that it has an internal security audit team, but failed to clearly disclose whether it limits or monitors employee access to user data (P13). It improved its disclosure of how it addresses security vulnerabilities by disclosing a program allowing researchers to report vulnerabilities (P14). However, the company lost points in this year&rsquo;s Index for disclosing less clear information about its policies for responding to data breaches (P15).</p>
