governance_value: 39
governance_text: | 
  <p>MTN disclosed weak governance and oversight over human rights issues. While it made some improvement by clarifying senior-level oversight over freedom of expression and privacy issues (G2), it fell short on most other indicators in this category. It published very limited information about conducting human rights impact assessments, failing to disclose whether it assesses freedom of expression and privacy related risks associated with its use of automated decision-making or its targeted advertising practices (G4). It had grievance and remedy mechanisms for users to submit their freedom of expression and privacy related complaints, but did not disclose its remedy procedures or specify a time frame for redressing these complaints (G6).</p>

  <p>MTN disclosed almost nothing about policies and practices affecting freedom of expression, tying with Bharti Airtel for the lowest score of all telecommunications companies in this category. It provided no information at all about how it handles external requests to block content or deactivate accounts&mdash;it disclosed nothing about its process for handling government and private requests to block content or restrict user accounts (F5-F7). South African law does not prevent companies from disclosing information about how they handle these requests, nor does it prohibit them from publishing this data.</p><p>It also lacked transparency about its own internal processes for enforcing its rules: The terms for MTN South Africa&rsquo;s mobile and broadband services were not easy to find or understand (F1), and the company did not commit to notifying users of changes to these services (F2).<a href="#fn5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup></a> In addition, the operator revealed nothing about its network management policies and did not publish a clear commitment to uphold net neutrality (F9). Although it clarified reasons why it may shut down its networks, MTN still did not sufficiently disclose its policies for handling government network shutdown orders (F10).</p>

  <p>MTN failed to disclose sufficient information about policies and practices affecting the privacy and security of its users, ranking tenth out of the 12 telecommunications companies in this category, ahead of only Etisalat and Ooredoo. MTN South Africa provided minimal information about the types of user information it collects and why (P3, P5), and no information about what information it shares (P4), or for how long it retains user information (P6). It also did not disclose any options for users to control what information the company collects and uses (P7), or options for users to obtain all of the information the company holds on them (P8).</p><p>MTN failed to provide any information about how it handles third-party requests for user information (P10-P12). The only piece of information MTN had previously disclosed was a commitment to push back on inappropriate or overbroad government requests; however, researchers were unable to locate such information in current company disclosures. While regulations in South Africa may discourage companies from publishing information about government requests for user information, including the fact that a request was made, nothing prevents MTN from fully disclosing how it handles private requests and the number of these requests it received and with which it complied.</p><p>The operating company MTN South Africa disclosed minimal information about its security policies, outperforming only Celcom (Axiata), Etisalat UAE, and Ooredoo Qatar on this set of indicators (P13-P18). It disclosed less than nearly all of its peers about its internal mechanisms to keep user information secure (P13)&mdash;but was one of only five telecommunications companies evaluated to disclose anything about its processes for addressing security vulnerabilities (P14). Like many of its peers, MTN South Africa provided no information about its policies for responding to data breaches (P15).</p>
