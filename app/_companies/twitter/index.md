It failed to disclose sufficient information about its policies to ensure the privacy and security of users&rsquo; data, and of its governance processes in place to ensure respect for human rights compared to its U.S. peers. In addition, Twitter&rsquo;s disclosure declined in a few key areas, as the company revealed less comprehensive information about government requests it received to remove or restrict content or accounts and its data retention policies.<br /><br /></p><hr /><p><br /><strong>Twitter, Inc.</strong> operates a global social media platform with products and services that allow users to create, share, and find content on the Twitter social network, and livestream videos on Periscope.

  <p>Despite some improvements, Twitter had weak disclosure of its governance and oversight over human rights issues, scoring lower than most U.S. internet and mobile ecosystem companies in this category. While it disclosed that it regularly engages with a range of stakeholders on freedom of expression and privacy issues (G5), Twitter is not a member of a multi-stakeholder initiative like the Global Network Initiative (GNI), which sets standards for how ICT companies should respect users&rsquo; human rights.. The company clarified that it educates employees about its privacy policies and disclosed a whistleblower policy to allow employees to submit privacy-related complaints, but not those related to freedom of expression (G3). Twitter disclosed some information about conducting human rights risk assessments when launching new products or entering into new markets, but did not disclose whether it conducts risk assessments related to its use of automated decision-making or targeted advertising (G4). Twitter&rsquo;s complaints mechanisms were stronger than Google&rsquo;s and Facebook&rsquo;s but it was less clear how users can submit grievances related to privacy (G6).</p>

  <p>Although Twitter disclosed more than most of its peers about policies affecting users freedom of expression&mdash;earning the second-best score in this category, behind Google&mdash;its overall score in this category declined slightly, and its disclosure fell short in a number of key areas.</p><p>Twitter earned the top score among its peers for clear disclosure of its rules and its processes for enforcing them (F3, F4, F8). It took a step forward by publishing a comprehensive Twitter Rules Enforcement report detailing what actions the company took to enforce its terms, but it was not clear if the company plans to publish this data on a regular basis, nor was the data available in a structured format (F4).<a href="#fn4"><sup>4</sup></a> It also earned a score improvement by clarifying that when it restricts content or accounts for violating its rules, it will notify Twitter users attempting to access the restricted content of the reason for the restriction (F8).</p><p>Twitter also performed relatively well on its disclosure about how it handles government and private requests to restrict accounts, disclosing less than only Google and Verizon Media (F5-F7).<a href="#fn5"><sup>5</sup></a> It clarified its process for responding to court orders and committed to carry out due diligence on government requests to remove or restrict content or accounts, including by pushing back against inappropriate or overbroad requests (F5). However, Twitter&rsquo;s data regarding content or account restriction requests for no longer included as much information for Periscope (F6).</p>

  <p>Twitter disclosed less about its privacy policies than most of its U.S. peers&mdash;including Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Verizon Media. It provided little information about its security policies, earning the second-lowest score on these indicators (P13-P18). Like most companies, it failed to disclose any information about how it responds to data breaches (P15). It lacked clear disclosure about its encryption practices (P16). It also disclosed less than all of its U.S. peers, aside from Facebook, about steps it takes to help users keep their accounts secure (P17).</p><p>Twitter disclosed less than most of its U.S. peers about how it handles government and private requests to hand over user data (P10-P12) It revealed some information about how it responds to government requests, but not private requests (P10). Twitter tied with Facebook and Apple for disclosing the most data on third-party request for user information it received and complied with (P11). However, like other U.S. companies, it did not divulge the exact number of requests received for user data under Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) requests or National Security Letters (NSLs), or the actions it took in response to these requests, since it is prohibited by law from doing so.<a href="#fn6"><sup>6</sup></a></p><p>On a positive note, Twitter earned the top score among internet and mobile ecosystem companies for disclosure of how it handles user information (P3-P9). It disclosed clear information about what types of user data it collects and how (P3). It clarified why it may track users across third party apps or websites (P9). It also disclosed an option for Periscope users to download some of their data (P8). Although it disclosed more than most companies about its data retention policies, Twitter was less transparent than in the previous year about if and when it deletes user information after users close their accounts (P6).</p>
