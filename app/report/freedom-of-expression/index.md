Freedom of Expression
=====================

**Users are in the dark about the role that governments, private parties, and companies themselves play in policing the flow of information online.**

Internet and mobile ecosystem companies act as powerful gatekeepers of global communication flows. Companies police content and regulate access to services according to their own private rules, and also at the request of governments and other third parties.

> **Regulations affecting freedom of expression enacted around the world since 2018**
> 
> **The European Union—**in April 2019, the EU approved the Terrorist Content Regulation, requiring platforms to remove content within an hour of notification.<sup>9</sup> It also approved the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market, which was heavily contested by digital rights activists for including measures critics say could undermine freedom of expression and lead to over censoring content.<sup>10</sup>
> 
> **France—**in December 2018, France enacted a new misinformation law. Designed to impose strict rules on the media during the three months preceding any election, the law targets “fake news” that seeks to influence electoral outcomes.
> 
> **Germany—**in January 2018 the Network Enforcement Act (NetzDG) went into effect. It targets the dissemination of hate speech and other illegal content online by requiring social networks to remove content within 24 hours of notification, or face hefty fines.
> 
> **The United Kingdom—**in October 2017, the UK published an Internet Safety Strategy green paper intended to help make it the "safest place in the world to be online." In April 2019 the government also published an Online Harms White Paper which proposes making internet companies responsible for illegal, harmful, or disreputable content on their platforms and introduce a new regulator with enforcement authority.
> 
> **China—**in November 2018, China released the Regulation on Security Assessment of Internet Information Services Having Public-Opinion Attributes or Social Mobilization Capabilities. It obliges companies to monitor—and in some instances block—signs of social mobilization and opinions deemed threatening by the government.
> 
> **India—**in December 2018, India published the Information Technology [Intermediary Guidelines (Amendment) Rules]. Under the draft rules, officials could demand social media companies to remove certain posts or videos. It would also weaken privacy protections of messaging services, allowing authorities to trace messages to their original senders.

<a id="section-41"></a>4.1 Transparency remains inadequate
----------------------------------------------------------

Internet and mobile ecosystem companies act as powerful gatekeepers of global communication flows. Companies police content and regulate access to services according to their own private rules, and also at the request of governments and other third parties.

<a id="section-42"></a>4.2 Terms of service and enforcement

Internet and mobile ecosystem companies act as powerful gatekeepers of global communication flows. Companies police content and regulate access to services according to their own private rules, and also at the request of governments and other third parties.

<a id="section-45"></a>4.5 Regulatory developments and challenge
----------------------------------------------------------------

Internet and mobile ecosystem companies act as powerful gatekeepers of global communication flows. Companies police content and regulate access to services according to their own private rules, and also at the request of governments and other third parties.

<a id="section-46"></a>4.6 Recommendations for companies
--------------------------------------------------------

It is fair to expect companies to set rules prohibiting certain content or activities—like toxic speech or malicious behavior. However, when companies develop and enforce rules about what people can do and say on the internet—or whether they can access a service at all—they must do so in a way that is transparent and accountable. It is also fair to expect governments to set limits on freedom of expression for these companies to abide by, so long as those limitations are lawful, proportionate, and for a justifiable purpose, as outlined in international human rights instruments.[[60]](#footnotes) But people have a right to know how and why their speech or access to information may be restricted or otherwise shaped by companies—whether at the behest of governments, in compliance with laws, or for the companies’ own commercial reasons.

The 2018 Index therefore includes six indicators measuring corporate transparency about processes for censoring online content or restricting access to their platforms or services. Collectively, these indicators evaluate company disclosure of policies and mechanisms for compliance with government requests, court orders, and other lawful third-party requests as well as for the enforcement of private rules, set by the company, about what types of speech and activities are permissible.[[61]](#footnotes) We expect companies to clearly disclose what types of content and activities they prohibit (F3), and to publish data about the volume and nature of content and accounts they remove or restrict for violating these rules (F4). Companies should also clearly disclose policies for responding to all types of third-party requests to restrict content and user accounts (F5), and publish data about the types of such requests they receive and with which they comply (F6, F7). We expect companies to notify users when they have removed content, restricted a user’s account, or otherwise restricted access to content or a service (F8).
