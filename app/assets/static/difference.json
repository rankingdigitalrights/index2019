Samsung also improved its privacy score by clarifying how it directly notifies users of changes to privacy policies (<a href='https://rankingdigitalrights.org/index2018/indicators/p2/'>P2</a>), and by improving its disclosure related to how it handles user information after a user’s account is terminated (<a href='https://rankingdigitalrights.org/index2018/indicators/p6/'>P6</a>). Notably, the company provided users with more options to control how their user information is used for targeted advertising (<a href='https://rankingdigitalrights.org/index2018/indicators/p7/'>P7</a>), although this suggests that targeted advertising is on by default. However, its disclosure also became less clear about whether it combines user information across services (<a href='https://rankingdigitalrights.org/index2018/indicators/p5/'>P5</a>). <a href='https://rankingdigitalrights.org/index2018/companies/samsung/'>Read Samsung’s report card for more</a>.",
