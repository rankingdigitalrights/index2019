introduction: "The Privacy category of the Corporate Accountability Index contains 18 indicators measuring whether corporate commitments and disclosure of policies affecting users’ privacy. Indicators in this category evaluate whether the company’s policies and commitments demonstrate concrete ways in which it respects the right to privacy of users, as articulated in the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/\" target=\"_blank\">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> and other international human rights instruments. The company’s disclosed policies should demonstrate how it works to avoid contributing to actions that may interfere with users’ privacy, except where such actions are lawful, proportionate and for a justifiable purpose. They will also demonstrate a strong commitment to protect and defend users’ digital security. Companies that perform well on these indicators demonstrate a strong public commitment to transparency not only in terms of how they respond to government and others’ demands, but also how they determine, communicate, and enforce private rules and commercial practices that affect users’ privacy."
