introduction: | 
  <p>The Governance category contains six indicators that measure if and how companies disclose governance processes designed to ensure that they respect the human rights to freedom of expression and privacy. Both rights are part of the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> and are enshrined in the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a>. They apply online as well as offline. For the&nbsp;company to perform well in this section, disclosure should follow&mdash;and ideally surpass&mdash;the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/GuidingPrinciplesBusinessHR_EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights</a> and other industry-specific human rights standards for freedom of expression and privacy such as the <a href="https://globalnetworkinitiative.org/gni-principles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Network Initiative Principles</a>.</p>
