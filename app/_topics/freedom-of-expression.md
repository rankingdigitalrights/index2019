introduction: | 
  <p>The Freedom of Expression category contains 11 indicators that measure corporate disclosure of policies affecting users&rsquo; freedom of expression. Indicators in this category evaluate whether the company demonstrates concrete ways in which it respects users&rsquo; right to freedom of expression, as articulated in the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>, the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a>, and other international human rights instruments. A company&rsquo;s disclosed policies should demonstrate how it works to avoid contributing to actions that may interfere with this right, except where such actions are lawful, proportionate, and for a justifiable purpose. Companies that perform well in this category demonstrate a strong public commitment to transparency, not only in terms of how they comply with laws and regulations or respond to government demands, but also how they determine, communicate, and enforce private rules and commercial practices that affect users&rsquo; freedom of expression.</p>
