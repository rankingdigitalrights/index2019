introduction: "The Freedom of Expression category of the Corporate Accountability Index contains 11 indicators measuring corporate disclosure of policies affecting users’ freedom of expression. Indicators in this category evaluate whether the company demonstrates concrete ways in which it respects the right to freedom of expression of users, as articulated in the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights\" target=\"_blank\">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> and other international human rights instruments. The company’s disclosed policies should demonstrate how it works to avoid contributing to actions that may interfere with this right, except where such actions are lawful, proportionate and for a justifiable purpose. Companies that perform well here demonstrate a strong public commitment to transparency, not only in terms of how they comply with laws and regulations or respond to government demands, but also how they determine, communicate, and enforce private rules and commercial practices that affect users’ freedom of expression."
