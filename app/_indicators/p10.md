research: <p>Companies increasingly receive requests to turn over user information. These requests can come from government agencies or courts (both domestic and foreign), as well as from private entities (i.e. non-governmental and non-judicial entities) We expect companies to publicly disclose their process for responding to requests from each type of third party, along with the basis for complying with these requests. Companies should also publicly commit to pushing back on inappropriate or overbroad government and private requests.</p><p>In some cases, the law might prevent a company from disclosing information referenced in this indicator’s elements. Researchers will document situations where this is the case, but a company will still lose points if it fails to meet all elements. This represents a situation where the law causes companies to fall short of best practice, and we encourage companies to advocate for laws that enable them to fully respect users’ rights to freedom of expression and privacy.</p><p><b>Potential sources:</b></p><ul><li>Company transparency report</li><li>Company law enforcement guidelines</li><li>Company privacy policy</li><li>Company blog posts</li></ul>
