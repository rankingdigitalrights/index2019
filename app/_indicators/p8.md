  <p>Users should be able to obtain all information that companies hold about them. We expect companies to clearly disclose what options users have to obtain this information, what data this record contains, and what formats users can obtain it in. For mobile ecosystems, we expect the company to disclose to users whether the apps that are available in its app store specify that users can obtain all of the user information that app holds about them.</p><p><strong>Potential sources:</strong></p><ul><li>Company privacy policy</li><li>Company account settings</li><li>Company help center</li><li>Company blog posts</li></ul>
