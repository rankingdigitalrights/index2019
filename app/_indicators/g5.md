research: <p>This indicator seeks evidence that the company engages with its stakeholders—and particularly with stakeholders who face clear human rights risks in connection with their online activities. We expect stakeholder engagement to be a core component of a company’s policy development and impact assessment process. Stakeholder engagement should be carried out across the full range of issues related to users’ freedom of expression and privacy, including a company’s process for developing terms of service, privacy, and identity policies along with the enforcement practices for those policies.</p><p>Engaging with stakeholders, especially those who operate in high-risk environments, can be sensitive. A company may not feel comfortable publicly disclosing specific details about which stakeholders it consults, where or when they meet, and what they discuss. While we encourage companies to provide details about non-sensitive stakeholder engagement, we seek, at minimum, public disclosure that a company engages with stakeholders who are or represent users whose rights to freedom of expression and privacy are at risk. One way the public knows a company participates in this type of engagement is through its involvement in a multi-stakeholder initiative that brings the company in touch with representatives from various stakeholder groups including human rights organizations and others who advocate for the rights of at-risk groups.</p><p>If a company receives full credit on Element 1, it will automatically receive full credit on Element 2 and Element 3.</p><p><b>Potential sources:</b></p><ul><li>Company CSR/sustainability report</li><li>Company annual report</li><li>Company blog</li><li>Membership lists on the Global Network Initiative and Industry Dialogue websites</li><li>Company FAQ or Help Center</li></ul>
