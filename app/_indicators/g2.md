  <p>This indicator seeks evidence that the company&rsquo;s governance and internal management structures include consideration of freedom of expression and privacy. Decisions made by executives and managers of internet and telecommunications companies significantly affect people&rsquo;s ability to experience freedom of expression and privacy. We expect these decision-making processes, and the chain of responsibility within the company, to explicitly consider these human rights.</p><p>To receive full credit for this indicator, companies need to clearly disclose that at each governance level (board, executive, managerial), there is clear oversight of both freedom of expression and privacy issues. At the board level, this oversight could include a board of directors or another public explanation of how the board exercises oversight of the company&rsquo;s freedom of expression and privacy policy commitments. Below board level, it can include a company unit or individual that reports to the executive or managerial level. The committee, program, team, officer, etc. should specifically identify freedom of expression and privacy in its description of responsibilities.</p><p><strong>Potential sources:</strong></p><ul><li>List of board of directors</li><li>Company governance documents</li><li>Company sustainability report</li><li>Company organizational chart</li><li>Company human rights policy</li><li>Global Network Initiative documents (if company is a member)</li></ul>
