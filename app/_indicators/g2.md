research: <p>This indicator seeks evidence that the company’s governance and internal management structures include consideration of freedom of expression and privacy. Decisions made by executives and managers of ICT companies significantly affect people’s ability to experience freedom of expression and privacy. We expect these decision-making processes, and the chain of responsibility within the company, to explicitly consider these human rights.</p><p>To receive full credit for this indicator, companies need to clearly disclose that there is clear oversight over both freedom of expression and privacy issues at each governance level (board, executive, managerial). At the board of directors level, oversight could be carried out explicitly by a board committee, or the company may provide another public explanation of how the board exercises oversight of freedom of expression and privacy. Below board-level, oversight may be carried out by a company unit or individual that reports to the executive or managerial level. The committee, program, team, officer, etc. should specifically identify freedom of expression and privacy in its description of responsibilities.</p><p><b>Potential sources:</b></p><ul><li>List of board of directors</li><li>Company governance documents</li><li>Company sustainability report</li><li>Company organizational chart</li><li>Company human rights policy</li><li>Global Network Initiative documents (if company is a member)</li><li>Telecommunications Industry Dialogue documents (if the company is a member)</li></ul>
