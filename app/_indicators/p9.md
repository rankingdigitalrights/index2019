research: <p>We expect companies to disclose what information about users they collect from third parties, which in this case typically means information collected from third-party websites or apps through technical means, for instance through cookies, plug-ins, or widgets. Company disclosure of these practices helps users understand if and how their activities are being tracked by companies even when they are not on a host company’s website.</p><p>One prominent user-generated signal is the “<a target="_blank" href="https://rankingdigitalrights.org/2018-indicators/#donottrack">Do Not Track</a>” standard. Also known by the acronym “DNT,” this refers to a setting in a user’s browser preferences which tells entities not to “track” them. In other words, every time a user loads a website, any parties that are involved in delivering the page (of which there are often many, primarily advertisers) are told not to collect or store any information about the user’s visit to the page. However, this is merely a polite request—a company may ignore a DNT request, and many do.</p><p><b>Potential sources:</b></p><ul><li>Company privacy policy</li><li>Company policy on third parties</li></ul>
