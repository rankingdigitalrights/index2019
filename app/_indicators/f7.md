research: <p>Companies frequently receive requests from private parties to remove, filter, or restrict content or accounts. We expect companies to regularly publish data about the number and type of private requests it receives, and the number of such requests with which it complies.. This indicator focuses on private requests that come through some sort of defined or organized process. This can be a process established by law, (e.g., requests made under the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the European Right to be Forgotten ruling, etc.) or a self-regulatory arrangement (e.g., company agreements to block certain types of images). This indicator does not examine company reporting on content or accounts restricted under terms of service enforcement mechanisms; that is evaluated in indicator F4.</p><p>In some cases, the law might prevent a company from disclosing information referenced in this indicator’s elements. For example, we expect companies to publish exact numbers rather than ranges of numbers. We acknowledge that laws sometimes prevent companies from doing so, and researchers will document situations where this is the case. But a company will lose points if it fails to meet all elements. This represents a situation where the law causes companies to be uncompetitive, and we encourage companies to advocate for laws that enable them to fully respect users’ rights to freedom of expression and privacy.</p><p><b>Potential sources:</b></p><ul><li>Company transparency report</li></ul>
