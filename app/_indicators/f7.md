  <p>Companies frequently receive requests from parties via private (non-government or non-judicial) processes to remove, filter, or restrict content or accounts. We expect companies to regularly publish data about the number and type of requests received through private processes, and the number of such requests with which it complies. This indicator focuses on requests that come through some sort of defined or organized process. This can be a process established by law, (e.g., requests made under the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the European Right to be Forgotten ruling, etc.) or a self-regulatory arrangement (e.g., company agreements to block certain types of images). This indicator does not examine company reporting on content or accounts restricted under terms of service enforcement mechanisms; that is evaluated in indicator F4.</p><p><strong>Potential sources:</strong></p><ul><li>Company transparency report</li></ul>
