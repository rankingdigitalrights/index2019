research: <p>This indicator is only applicable to telecommunications companies. Network shutdowns are a growing threat to human rights. The <a href="http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/dpage_e.aspx?si=A/HRC/32/L.20">UN Human Rights Council</a> has condemned network shutdowns as a violation of international human rights law and called on governments to refrain from taking these actions. Yet governments are <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton">increasingly ordering</a> telecommunications companies to shut down their networks, which in turn puts pressure on companies to take actions that violate their responsibility to respect human rights. We expect companies to fully disclose to the circumstances under which they might take such action and to report on the requests they receive to take such actions.</p><p><b>Potential Sources:</b></p><ul><li>Company terms of service, acceptable use policy, community standards, content guidelines, abusive behavior policy, or similar document that explains the rules users have to follow.</li><li>Company transparency report</li><li>Company law enforcement guidelines</li></ul>
