  <p>A company&rsquo;s terms of service outline the relationship between the user and the company. These terms contain rules about prohibited content and activities and companies can also take action against users for violating the rules described in the terms. Given this, we expect companies to ensure that the terms are easy for access and understand.</p><p>This indicator evaluates if the company&rsquo;s terms are easy for users to locate.&nbsp;A document that is easy to find is located on the homepage of the company or service, or one or two clicks away from the homepage, or in a logical place where users can expect to find it. The terms should also be available in the major language(s) of the primary operating market. In addition, we expect a company to take steps to help users understand the information presented in their documents. This includes, but is not limited to, providing summaries, tips, or guidance that explain what the terms mean, using section headers, readable font size, or other graphic features to help users understand the document, or writing the terms using readable syntax.</p><p><strong>Potential sources:</strong></p><ul><li>Company terms of service, terms of use, terms and conditions, etc.</li><li>Company acceptable use policy, community guidelines, rules, etc.</li></ul>
