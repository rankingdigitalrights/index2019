element: <ol><li>Does the company <a target="_blank" href="https://rankingdigitalrights.org/2018-indicators/#require">require</a> users to verify their identity with their <a target="_blank" href="https://rankingdigitalrights.org/2018-indicators/#governmentid">government-issued identification</a>, or with other forms of identification that could be connected to their offline identity?</li></ol>
research: <p>The ability to communicate anonymously is essential to freedom of expression both on and offline. The use of a real name online, or requiring users to provide a company with identifying information, provides a link between online activities and a specific person. This presents human rights risks to those who, for example, voice opinions that don’t align with a government’s views or who engage in activism that a government does not permit. It also presents risks for people who are persecuted for religious beliefs or sexual orientation.</p><p>We therefore expect companies to disclose whether they might ask users to verify their identities using government-issued ID or other forms of identification that could be connected to their offline identity. We acknowledge that users may have to provide information that could be connected to their offline identity in order to access paid features of various products and services. However, users should be able to access features that don’t require payment without needing to provide information that can be tied to their offline identity.</p><p>This indicator is applicable to internet companies, mobile ecosystem companies, and pre-paid mobile services (for telecommunications companies).</p><p><b>Potential sources:</b></p><ul><li>Company terms of service or equivalent document</li><li>Company help center</li><li>Company sign up page</li></ul>
