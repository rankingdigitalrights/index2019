  <p>It is common for companies to change their terms of service as their business evolves. However these changes, which can include rules about prohibited content and activities, can have a significant impact on users&rsquo; freedom of expression rights. We therefore expect companies to commit to notify users when they change these terms and to provide users with information that helps them understand what these changes mean.</p><p>This indicator seeks clear disclosure by companies of the method and timeframe for notifying users about changes to their terms of service. We expect companies to commit to directly notify users prior to those changes coming into effect. The method of direct notification may differ according to the type of service. For services that contain user accounts, direct notification may involve sending an email or an SMS. For services that do not require a user account, direct notification may involve posting a prominent notice on the main page where users access the service. This indicator also seeks evidence that a company provides publicly available records of previous terms so that people can understand how the company&rsquo;s terms have evolved over time.</p><p><strong>Potential sources:</strong></p><ul><li>Company terms of service</li></ul>
