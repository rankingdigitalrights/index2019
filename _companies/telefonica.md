analysis_text: "Telefónica ranked third out of 10 telecommunications companies evaluated, after Vodafone and AT&T, and disclosed a strong commitment to protecting users’ freedom of expression and privacy. As a full member of the Global Network Initiative (GNI) since March 2017, the company now commits to engaging with a range of stakeholders on freedom of expression and privacy issues. The company made numerous improvements in the 2018 Index, including clarifying its process for handling government requests to shut down networks and providing more data about government requests for user data. Despite positive steps, the company could be more transparent about policies affecting users’ freedom of expression by publishing more data about government and private requests it receives to block content or accounts, as there are no legal obstacles in its home market of Spain preventing the company from doing so. It could also improve its commitments to protect users’ privacy by disclosing what user data it shares and with whom, and by providing greater clarity about what steps it takes to keep user information secure."
