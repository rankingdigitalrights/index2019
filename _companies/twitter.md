analysis_text: "Twitter ranked fifth out of 12 internet and mobile ecosystem companies, disclosing less about its policies affecting privacy than most of its U.S. peers. The company’s score improved in the 2018 Index due to improved public commitments to users’ freedom of expression and greater clarity in its transparency reporting on content removal requests. However, Twitter’s privacy score declined due to a change in its privacy policy stating that the company no longer responds to “Do Not Track” signals, and a lack of clear examples about how it implements its process for responding to government or private requests for user information. In addition,<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2048\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. law</a> prevents companies from disclosing the exact number of government requests for stored and real-time user information they receive, which prevented Twitter from being fully transparent in that area."

key_recommendation_paragraph: "<strong>Twitter, Inc.</strong> operates a global social sharing platform with products and services that allow users to create, share, and find content on the Twitter social network and to livestream videos on Periscope. Twitter also provides advertising services and developer tools."

key_recommendation_list:
  - <strong>Institutionalize policy commitments to freedom of expression and privacy.</strong> Twitter should demonstrate that it has institutionalized comments to respect users' digital rights by disclosing whether and how it is implementing policies such as employee training and human rights impact assessments.
  - <strong>Protect users’ privacy.</strong> The company should show a stronger commitment to protect users' privacy by not sharing users' information for targeted advertising unless they opt in. It should also commit to respect signals from users to not track them across third-party websites.
  - <strong>Disclose more comprehensive information about security policies and practices.</strong> Twitter should improve its disclosure of its internal processes for keeping user data secure, including the company’s policies for responding to data breaches.

governance_text: "Twitter ranked fifth in the Governance category, scoring lower than most U.S. internet and mobile ecosystem companies evaluated, despite some notable improvements. The company strengthened its public commitment to respect users’ freedom of expression and privacy (G1), improved its disclosure of senior-level oversight over these issues (G2), and disclosed a commitment to conduct human rights risk assessments when launching new products or entering into new markets (G4). While it disclosed that it regularly engages with a range of stakeholders on freedom of expression and privacy issues (G5), Twitter is not a member of a multi-stakeholder initiative like the Global Network Initiative (GNI), whose members not only make commitments but also undergo independent assessments to verify whether they have implemented and institutionalized them. As a result, Twitter’s disclosure in the Governance category suffered compared to its other U.S.-based peers."

However, the data did not include all of the actions the company might take to enforce its rules.<br /><br /><strong>Content and account restriction requests:</strong> Twitter disclosed less than Google and Oath about how it handles government and private requests to restrict content or accounts (F5-F7).

privacy_text: "Twitter disclosed less than Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Oath about policies affecting users’ privacy, but more than Facebook.<br /><br /><strong>Handling of user information:</strong> Twitter offered more information than all other internet and mobile ecosystem companies about how it handles user information, but still fell short of Index benchmarks (P3-P9).

It disclosed more than any other company about how long it retains user information (P6), but disclosed little about whether users could access the information the company holds about them (P8). The company provides users with options for controlling how their information is collected for targeted advertising, suggesting targeted advertising is on by default (P7). Twitter’s revised privacy policy made its practices of tracking users across third-party websites less clear (P9). The company also disclosed it no longer respects “Do Not Track” (DNT) signals (P9).<br /><br /><strong>Requests for user information:</strong> Twitter disclosed more than most of its peers, apart from Microsoft and Google, about how it handles government and private requests to hand over use data (P10-P12). Like most companies, it clearly disclosed its processes for responding to government requests for user information, but not for private requests it received (P10).

Like most companies, it failed to disclose any information about its policies for responding to data breaches (P15). It also lacked clear disclosure of whether it encrypts user communications and private content (P16)."
